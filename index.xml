      <description>This post was originally published on the Authzed Blog.
Today we&amp;rsquo;re announcing the availability of API latency metrics in the Authzed dashboard. Now Authzed users can see the performance of their API usage and more easily correlate performance of Authzed with their own applications.
Authzed is a database and service that stores, computes, and validates your application&amp;rsquo;s permissions.
Developers create a schema that models their permissions requirements and use client libraries to apply the schema to the database, insert data into the database, and query the data to efficiently check permissions in their applications.</description>

      <description>This is a cross-post originally written for the Buf blog.
The first day of the rest of your life Congrats! You&amp;rsquo;ve hit a stable release or maybe you haven&amp;rsquo;t and instead customers have already decided to depend on your API. Rather than pulling the rug out from beneath your users, you&amp;rsquo;ve taken it upon yourself to keep everyone happy. Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve been tasked with maintaining API compatibility, you&amp;rsquo;ll need a guiding light to copy for inspiration.</description>

      <description>Setting the scene It&amp;rsquo;s a crisp Monday morning, err &amp;ndash; 11AM &amp;ndash; close enough. You take a seat at your desk and sip your coffee to avoid the chill you get from loading JIRA to find today&amp;rsquo;s task. Like some kind of haiku straight from hell, the ticket reads:
 As a user that&amp;rsquo;s a part of many organizations, I&amp;rsquo;d like to see all the resources that I can access on my profile page.</description>

      <title>Identity Is Not the Foundation of Permission Systems</title>

      <description>This post was originally published on the Authzed Blog.
Have you ever chatted with a fellow developer about an application&amp;rsquo;s permission system and quickly realized you&amp;rsquo;re also talking about its login system? It&amp;rsquo;s rather unfortunate, but these two entirely distinct systems often get merged together simply because their formal names start with the same four letters: AUTH.
 Authentication (&amp;ldquo;authN&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;identity&amp;rdquo;) is who you are
Authorization (&amp;ldquo;authZ&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;permissions&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;access control&amp;rdquo;) is what you&amp;rsquo;re allowed to do</description>

      <description>Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that many software engineers either aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with other roles at their organization or are often confused by them. This is by no fault of their own because managerial roles differ from company to company and often people overextend their responsibilities to make up for a deficiency in the organization.
 It also doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that so many of them have roughly the same abbreviation: PM.</description>

      <title>A toolbox for your dotfiles</title>

      <description>So you may have heard about this Docker™ thing. You know; it runs containers and all that jazz. You might think the container craze is only for developers that think this time they&amp;rsquo;ve finally understood operations. You&amp;rsquo;d be wrong however. I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain a simple trick that I use often when sshing into a remote machine for some old school sysadmin work.
Totally lost? If the title of this post seems unintelligible, fear not!</description>

      <description>In 2016, CoreOS hired Antoine Legrand (@ant31). Antoine is an incredible engineer and a huge asset to the Kubernetes community; you may recognize him from many contributions, but most people probably would be familiar with a little project he started called Kubespray.
The first time I met Antoine, he had hacked together a demo of packaging up and storing Kubernetes resources into Quay. A fair bit after the initial demo, we decided it was worth pursuing for realsies and I helped Antoine through the process of making his demo a production grade feature for all Quay users.</description>

      <description>At KubeCon EU 2018, Red Hat eagerly announced the open sourcing of the Operator Framework. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of buzzword bingo these days, but being someone who helped originally pioneer the concept at CoreOS, I feel I can give a fair definition:
 An Operator is a Kubernetes pattern that is extending the Kubernetes control plane with a custom Controller and Custom Resource Definitions that add additional operational knowledge of an application.</description>

      <title>You&#39;re not running vanilla Kubernetes</title>

      <description>Stop pretending it isn&amp;rsquo;t your own clumsy distribution. Seriously.
 Haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of &amp;ldquo;vanilla Kubernetes&amp;rdquo;? In the ever competitive age of selling Kubernetes, there seems to be a trend towards promising vendor neutrality. After all, the promise of Kubernetes is to free you from the tyranny of your cloud provider, right? It&amp;rsquo;s only natural that the mentality of avoiding lock-in be applied to Kubernetes itself. The community has arrived on the colloquial term &amp;ldquo;vanilla Kubernetes&amp;rdquo; to describe an installation of the only the upstream components as released by the Kubernetes project.</description>

      <title>Please, don&#39;t recommend sourcing shell completion</title>

      <description>I recently got sick of opening a new tab and waiting seconds before my shell prompt showed up. In order to prevent my future self from wasting valuable seconds of my life, I went through the trouble of profiling my zsh configuration. After extensive use of zprof, I determined my bottleneck: sourcing command completion files, but only the ones that executed a program to get their contents.
Feast your eyes on the marvel that is modern software engineering:</description>

      <title>Jails, containers, and their perceived security</title>
      <link>https://jzelinskie.com/posts/jails-containers-and-their-perceived-security/</link>

      <description>My scroll-wheel stops. Under my mouse, the typical HN comment:
 Docker&amp;rsquo;s just about packaging! Containers aren&amp;rsquo;t secure! Unlike like jails *strokes unix beard*
 The world&amp;rsquo;s full of interesting partial truths.
Docker did clue a lot of developers into the Linux kernel&amp;rsquo;s isolation primitives by providing a compelling developer experience. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take long for others to catch on, though. In my semi-recent foray with FreeBSD, I noticed that managing jails with iocage doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel too far off managing containers with docker.</description>

      <description>Setting the scene It&amp;rsquo;s a crisp Monday morning, err &amp;ndash; 11AM &amp;ndash; close enough. You take a seat at your desk and sip your coffee to avoid the chill you get from loading JIRA to find today&amp;rsquo;s task. Like some kind of haiku straight from hell, the ticket reads:

      <description>This post was originally published on the Authzed Blog.
Have you ever chatted with a fellow developer about an application&amp;rsquo;s permission system and quickly realized you&amp;rsquo;re also talking about its login system? It&amp;rsquo;s rather unfortunate, but these two entirely distinct systems often get merged together simply because their formal names start with the same four letters: AUTH.
 Authentication (&amp;ldquo;authN&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;identity&amp;rdquo;) is who you are
Authorization (&amp;ldquo;authZ&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;permissions&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;access control&amp;rdquo;) is what you&amp;rsquo;re allowed to do</description>

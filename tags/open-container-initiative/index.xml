      <description>In 2016, CoreOS hired Antoine Legrand (@ant31). Antoine is an incredible engineer and a huge asset to the Kubernetes community; you may recognize him from many contributions, but most people probably would be familiar with a little project he started called Kubespray.
The first time I met Antoine, he had hacked together a demo of packaging up and storing Kubernetes resources into Quay. A fair bit after the initial demo, we decided it was worth pursuing for realsies and I helped Antoine through the process of making his demo a production grade feature for all Quay users.</description>

A fair bit after the initial demo, we decided it was worth pursuing for realsies and I helped Antoine through the process of making his demo a production grade feature for all Quay users.
The general idea was to take the existing docker registry protocol and extend it to support more than just containers.</p><h3 id=we-called-it-cnr>We called it CNR.</h3><p>CNR, which stood for Container Native Registry, was an awful name, so shortly after we rebranded it to <a href=https://github.com/app-registry>App Registry</a>.
The code was developed in the open, with weekly stand-ups in Kubernetes SIG Apps.
This is actually where I met a bunch of incredible people in the Kubernetes community &ndash; basically everyone that worked in the <a href=https://helm.sh>Helm</a> ecosystem.
One of the obvious gaps we felt the project could fill was the distribution of Helm charts and at the time Helm had just added a plugin system.
So, naturally, we built one.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/lp05rkUJKOY style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>The project had initial traction, but eventually the flame died out.
There were numerous reasons: no one had time to work on the project full-time, it was written in Python instead of Go, Helm plugins were insufficiently powerful enough at the time to get the user experience we needed, and we had intentionally left authentication and storage as an exercise to the reader if you weren&rsquo;t using Quay (which was closed source at the time).
Regardless, some Quay users still use the plugin to this day.</p><h3 id=fast-forward-to-today--->Fast forward to today &ndash;</h3><p>The docker registry specification has been donated to OCI and now there are more than just Kubernetes resources and Helm Charts floating around in the cloud-native ecosystem.
As a community, we&rsquo;ve realized that there&rsquo;s this super convenient place to store our containers, but where does everything else go? Enter the <a href=https://github.com/opencontainers/artifacts>OCI Artifact specification</a>.
The technical oversight committee for OCI just voted to approve its existence last week.
It would appear that everyone is happily making progress to the world Antoine and I had envisioned years earlier&mldr;</p><h3 id=things-can-never-be-that-simple>Things can never be that simple.</h3><p>As it stands today, the artifact specification is empty.
Why?
Because there are already two competing strategies on how to actually leverage OCI to store artifacts: <a href=https://github.com/deislabs/oras>ORAS</a> and <a href=https://github.com/docker/cnab-to-oci>CNAB-to-OCI</a>.
In addition, it&rsquo;s not quite clear where the line in the sand should be drawn in terms of what artifacts should be stored; taken to its logical conclusion, registries could just end up becoming a more complicated API for an object-store.</p><p>If you&rsquo;d like to know the gory details about what&rsquo;s going on you have two options: come to NYC and buy me <em>many</em> beers or join the <a href=https://github.com/opencontainers/org#communications>upstream OCI discussions</a>.
You should be scared because this is going to affect absolutely everyone&rsquo;s workflows in the future and if we get no feedback, you&rsquo;ll be stuck with our shit.</p><hr><p>Huge thanks to everyone that&rsquo;s been a part of this journey over the years:</p><ul><li>Antoine Legrand and the Quay team</li><li>Steve Lasker and the Azure Container Registry team</li><li>Josh Dolitsky and the rest of the Helm community</li><li>The OCI Distribution and Artifact Maintainers</li><li>The Docker CNAB team</li><li><strong>YOU &ndash; IF YOU GET INVOLVED RIGHT NOW!</strong></li></ul></div></main><div class="tl fixed list-pages lh-copy" id=contents-list></div><div class="pagination tc tr-l db fixed-l bottom-2-l right-2-l mb3 mb0-l"><a id=scroll-to-top class="f6 o-0 link br2 ph2 pv1 mb1 bg-main-color pointer" onclick=topFunction() style="color:#fff;visibility:hidden;display:none;transition:opacity .5s,visibility .5s" title="back to top">back to top</a><br><p class="mb0 mt2"><a href=https://jzelinskie.com/posts/olm/>prev post</a>
